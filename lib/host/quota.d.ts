/**
 * dsh-omnisearch — unified quota snapshots across providers.
 *
 * Research findings (2026-08): different backends expose balance differently:
 *   - Tavily    : GET /usage (Bearer) → usage/limit per feature       [authoritative]
 *   - Firecrawl : GET /v2/team/credit-usage (Bearer) → remaining/plan  [authoritative]
 *   - You.com   : GET /v1/billing/account_balance (X-API-Key) → cents  [authoritative]
 *   - Brave     : X-RateLimit-* response headers → monthly requests     [authoritative]
 *   - Exa       : no public balance API → local estimate only          [non-authoritative]
 *   - Jina/Serper/Perplexity : dashboard only                          [non-authoritative]
 *   - SearXNG/Ollama : self-hosted, no platform credits
 *
 * The UI renders snapshots uniformly but NEVER converts different units into
 * a fake percentage. The router only uses `authoritative` snapshots to skip
 * exhausted providers; non-authoritative ones are ignored for quota logic.
