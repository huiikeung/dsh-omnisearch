 *  - ordered (default): always start from the first available provider.
 *  - round-robin: rotate the start offset by 1 per query.
 *  - random: pick a random start offset per query.
 *
 * web_fetch does NOT participate in routing — it follows the deterministic
 * fetch-capable chain because not every provider supports page extraction.
